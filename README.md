# Tic-Tac-Toe-Standalone
This is a basic graphical Tic Tac Toe in Python 2.7, using the 'turtle' module

It uses Two modes, Player start and computer start mode. It also asks the user to input the size of the board.
The code uses to slightly different algorithms for Player start and Computer start mode.
The Graphical Interface is completely independent of the computing process and it is used for representation purposes only.
The program asks the user to enter the co-ordinates of the position where he wants to place the 'X'.
And The next turn the computer places it's 'O'. The program is mostly bug free. If any bugs arise let me know.
